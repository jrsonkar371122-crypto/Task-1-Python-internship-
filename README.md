Assignments:
This repository contains three basic Python assignments focused on user input handling, data structures, and fundamental operations like counting, summation, and averaging.

Assignment 1: Age Input Program
Description:
This program takes the user’s age as input and stores it as an integer.

Key Concepts Used:

input() function

Type conversion using int

Steps:

Take input from the user using input().

Convert the input into an integer to represent age.

Assignment 2: Character Count Program
Description:
This program counts the frequency of each character in a given input string.

Key Concepts Used:

String manipulation

Dictionary

Looping and conditional statements

Steps:

Take input from the user and convert it to lowercase.

Create an empty dictionary to store character counts.

Iterate through each character using a for loop.

If the character exists in the dictionary, increment its count.

If not, add the character with a count of 1.

Display the final dictionary containing character frequencies.

Assignment 3: List Operations (Sum, Average, Maximum)
Description:
This program accepts five numbers from the user and performs basic list operations.

Key Concepts Used:

Lists

Loops

Arithmetic operations

Built-in functions

Steps:

Create an empty list to store numbers.

Run a loop five times to take user input.

Append each number to the list.

Initialize a variable total to zero.

Use a loop to calculate the sum of all numbers.

Compute the average of the numbers.

Find the maximum number using the max() function.
